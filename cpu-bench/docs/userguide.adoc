== Introduction

*CPU-bench* measures the Degree of Parallism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_parallelism[DOP]) of a computer system ranging from laptop / desktop size machines to large-scale non-uniform memory access (NUMA) server architectures. The notion of executing tasks simultaniously are realized in computer systems in three distinct ways:

* Parallellism: 

* Concurrency

* Vectororization


== Installation

=== Linux

Install iperf3 from the provided RPM package:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd bin/rhel7-amd64
$ sudo rpm -ivh iperf3-3.1.3-1.fc24.x86_64.rpm
----


Validate that iperf3 is correctly installed:
[source,bash]
----
$ iperf3 --version
----


=== Windows

Install iperf3 from the provided .exe file:

[source,bash]
----
C:\> md c:\Apps\bin
C:\> copy net-bench\bin\win-x64\*.*  c:\Apps\bin
----

Validate that iperf3 is correctly installed:
[source,bash]
----
C:\> c:\Apps\bin\iperf3 --version
