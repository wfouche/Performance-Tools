= CPU-bench

== Overview

CPU-bench is a tool that measures the degree of parallelism (DOP) of a physical computer or virtual machine (VM). The DOP is the number of instructions that can be executed in parallel. A server might report that it has `N` logical CPUs, but depending on whether Hyper-Threading is enabled or not, and how CPU management is configured in the virtualization software (if used), the server might not be able to executed `N` instructions at the same time. CPU-bench reports:

* The number of logical CPUs assigned to a server.

* The DOP of that server.

If Hyper-threading is enabled, the DOP score is a lot less than the number of logical CPUs.
